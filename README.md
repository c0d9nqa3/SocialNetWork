# SocialNetWork

## Overview

SocialNetWork is a Java-based project that models social interaction through an undirected graph, using real-world email communication data from the European Institute. It analyzes communication patterns to uncover central individuals, active users, peripheral members, and community clusters within the dataset.

## Features

- Graph-based social network modeling  
- Detection of core and peripheral nodes  
- Identification of most active users  
- Community detection within the network  

## Technologies

- Java (JDK 8+)  
- Graph algorithms (custom implemented)  

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/c0d9nqa3/SocialNetWork.git
```

### 2. Open the Project

Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to open the project. Import it as a Java project.

### 3. Compile and Run

Ensure JDK is configured correctly in your IDE. Then build and run the `Main` class or equivalent entry point to start the analysis.

## Usage

- Prepare your input dataset (email logs) in the expected format.  
- Run the program to construct the undirected graph.  
- Use built-in analysis functions to:  
  - Find the core members of the network  
  - Detect isolated or peripheral nodes  
  - Identify the most active participants  
  - Analyze clusters or groups
